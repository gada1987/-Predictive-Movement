// jest-dom adds custom jest matchers for asserting on DOM nodes.
// This library extends the built-in Jest matchers with additional ones 
// tailored for testing DOM elements. It allows you to write more readable 
// and expressive assertions for your React components or other DOM-related tests.

// With jest-dom, you can use matchers like:
// expect(element).toHaveTextContent(/react/i)
// to assert that a DOM element contains specific text content,
// or other matchers for checking attributes, styles, and more.

// Learn more about the available matchers and usage at the official documentation:
// https://github.com/testing-library/jest-dom

// Import the jest-dom library so that its matchers are available globally in your test files.
